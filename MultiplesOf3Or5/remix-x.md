This solution is interesting.

```js
const solution = (number) => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
    if (i % 3 <= 0 || i % 5 <= 0) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
};
```

## Strategy

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

ðŸ““ In this problem all numbers are checked, only positive numbers are selected
and the sum of these numbers is returned, and negative numbers are ignored.

ðŸ““ Declare a valuable to which the accumulated numbers are added. Then search
the array and, if th number is positive, add to the variable, otherwise ignore
this number.

## Implementation

First, a variable is declared in which the result will be saved. Second, start
the cycle. In the cycle, take all the numbers between 0 and the given number.
And check for a multiplicity of 3 or 5.

## Possible Refactors

Yes, all the time there is an opportunity for refactoring. Maybe later.
