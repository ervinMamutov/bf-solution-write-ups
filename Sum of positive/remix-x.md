## Strategy

🖊️ You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

📓 In this problem all numbers are checked, only positive numbers are selected
and the sum of these numbers is returned, and negative numbers are ignored.

📓 Declare a valuable to which the accumulated numbers are added. Then search
the array and, if th number is positive, add to the variable, otherwise ignore
this number.
